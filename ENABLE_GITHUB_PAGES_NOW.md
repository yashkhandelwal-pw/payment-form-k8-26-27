## 📊 Check Deployment Status

**Go to Actions tab:**
```
https://github.com/yashkhandelwal-pw/payment-form-k8-26-27/actions
```

You'll see:
- ✅ Green checkmark = Deployed successfully!
- 🟡 Yellow circle = Deploying...
- ❌ Red X = Error (unlikely)

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE

### **This is a DEMO/PORTFOLIO version!**

**What Works:**
- ✅ Beautiful UI design
- ✅ Light theme colors
- ✅ Company logo
- ✅ Responsive layout
- ✅ All animations

**What Doesn't Work:**
- ❌ Backend API (no server on GitHub Pages)
- ❌ Form submission
- ❌ Database connections
- ❌ File uploads

**Why?**
GitHub Pages only hosts static HTML/CSS/JS files. Your Node.js backend cannot run on GitHub Pages.

**Solution:**
- Use GitHub Pages as a **demo/portfolio** showcase
- Use **localhost:8000** for full functionality
- Or deploy backend separately (see GITHUB_PAGES_SETUP.md)
