## 🎯 What's Deployed

The GitHub Pages site will include:
- ✅ Frontend (index.html, app.js, styles.css, config.js)
- ✅ Beautiful light theme UI
- ✅ Company logo
- ✅ Form validation

**Note:** Backend (`backend/server.js`) is NOT deployed on GitHub Pages. 
You'll need to deploy the backend separately (Heroku, Railway, Render, etc.) and update `config.js` with the backend URL.

---

## 🔧 Update Backend URL for Production

Once you deploy the backend, update `config.js`:

```javascript
// For production
const BACKEND_API_URL = 'https://your-backend-url.com/api';
```

Then commit and push again.
